        How was the travelling of the European population affected by the COVID-19 pandemic?
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        Revenge travelâ€™ is a term that emerged in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
        It refers to the phenomenon where people, after being restricted from travel due to lockdowns and safety concerns, 
        enthusiastically and impulsively embark on trips to make up for lost time. This concept is related to the desire to 
        "get back" at the pandemic for limiting our freedom and to make the most of newfound travel opportunities.
        In the graph below it is visualized the amount of money (EUR) spent by European citizens in travelling abroad.
        The data is collected from Eurostat and it is available for the period 2019-2022.
